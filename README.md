# NbtApps
An exploration of NBT data in .NET 6.0.

Currently contains two projects: 
* "NbtTools", a class library containing common elements to query NBT data; 
* "McMerchants", a webapp that displays all trades of all villagers in a given zone and lets you search for item stored in chests/shulker boxes/barrels in certain zones;

## How to use
Copy the `appsettings.json.dist` file to `appsettings.json` (and to `appsettings.Development.json` if needed) and edit the paths in the `MapPaths` section to match your Minecraft world.
